# Doodle
This is a Doodle application made with Java Swing. You can start drawing on the canvas and choose color and stoke thickness. You can also create a new file, and after finish drawing, you can save it in .txt file and load it for later if you want to continue to draw on that file. To quit, you can close the window or click on File->Exit. There are two options available on the View menu, Fit window or full size. Fit will scale the drawing according to the window size. Full size will always maintain the same size of the drawing. You can click the Play button to see the drawing from start to the end. Start button will go back to the first tick or the first state pf the drawing, and End button will go to the last state of the drawing. Additional features added are customizable color palette on the last two columns of the color palette. Both are functional with the color picker, so from there you can choose the color for the two columns on the last row of the color palette. The other additional feature is to play the animation of the drawing backward, or rewind it. Unfortunately, due to time constraint, the play and playback button won't be functional if you start from the middle of the slider. Also drawing from the middle of the animation will not work. So, please do not try these two because it will break the program. Other than that, I hope you enjoy this Doodle app for drawing!
